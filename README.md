Project Done for CS003A Class:        
  This project called for us to created a wordsearch that allows for diagonal and backwards placement through other words, but not including completely duplicate words 
  in the same positions.
  This project was done to improve our skills with Classes.
  The struct used for keeping track of Words is currently unneeded, and can be written in an easier to read format. However, for future implementation I want the ability
  to keep track of total words and where they are, I chose to do this through a vector of structs.

Things To Improve:              
Placement::NotOverlap() and Placement::ValidPlacement() need to be rewritten/abstracted for easier readability.
Would like to add a way to Play the game, as of now not implemented.
After implementing that, I'd like a way to restart without restarting program.
